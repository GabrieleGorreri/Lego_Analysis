##  📄 Exploring the Evolution of Lego!
Lego is a household name across the world, supported by a diverse toy line, hit movies, and a series of successful video games. In this project, we are going to explore a key development in the history of Lego: the introduction of licensed sets such as Star Wars, Super Heroes, and Harry Potter.

Lego has had its share of ups and downs since its inception in the early 20th century. This includes a particularly rough period in the late 90s. As described in this article, Lego was only able to survive due to a successful internal brand (Bionicle) and the introduction of its first licensed series: Star Wars.

The Account Executive responsible for the Star Wars partnership has asked for specific information in preparation for their meeting with the Star Wars team.

### Tools
- Python: Pandas, Plotly

##  📁 File Structure
Here below is the folder structure containing the files used in the analysis, and the python notebook:

```
Lego_Analysis
├── datasets
│   ├── lego_sets.csv
│   ├── parent_themes.csv
│   ├── sets.csv
│   ├── themes.csv
├── Lego_Analysis.ipynb
└── README.md
```

These are the varaibles for lego_sets.csv file:

| set_num | name | year | num_parts | theme_name | parent_theme |
|----|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|


These are the varaibles for parent_theme.csv file:

| id | name | is_licensed |
|----|------------|-------|


##  🔧 Tasks
- What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?

- In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year)?

- How many number of sets per year?
